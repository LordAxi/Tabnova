## ðŸ’¬ Translation

I am currently working on adding a translation / multi-language system. Since I donâ€™t speak every language, I would really appreciate your support!
If you want to contribute, simply download one of the existing language files (for example lang_en.json) out of the <a href="lang">lang folder </a>, translate the string values, and create a pull request with your new file (for example lang_de.json).
Thank you for helping make this project accessible to more people!
